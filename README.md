# cc3k-project
This is my CS246 final project. CC3K is a simplified version of a rogue-like game. It consists of a board of 79 columns and 30 rows high. The dungeon consists of 5 floors in exactly the same way, while each floor has 5 chambers and connecting passages. The player’s goal is to reach to the top of the floor; however, if player’s HP falls below zero, the player has lost and cannot continue. The player’s score is the total amount of gold collected. As a player, there are 5 characters to choose from: Shade(default), Drow, Vampire, Troll, and Goblin. During the game, the player will encounter various types of enemies, potion of unknown usage, and many more features to discover.
